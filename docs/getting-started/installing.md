# Installing Polyphony

## System Requirements

In order to use Polyphony you need to have:

- Linux or MacOS (sorry, there are no plans to support Windows for the time
  being)
- Ruby (MRI) 2.6 or newer

## Installing the Polyphony Gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'polyphony'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install polyphony
```
