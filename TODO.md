- Implement `LibevAgent#connect` API
- Reimplement Channel, Mutex using Queue

-- Add `Fiber#schedule_with_priority` method, aliased by `Fiber#wakeup`
- Implement agent interface is virtual function table
- Implement proxy agent for plugging in a user-provided agent class

- Debugging
  - Eat your own dogfood: need a good tool to check what's going on when some
    test fails
  - Needs to work with Pry (can write perhaps an extension for pry)
  - First impl in Ruby using `TracePoint` API
  - Mode of operation:
    - Two parts: tracer and controller
      - The tracer keeps state
      - The controller interacts with the user and tells the tracer what to do
      - Tracer and controller interact using fiber message passing
      - The controller lives on a separate thread
      - The tracer invokes the controller at the appropriate point in time
        according to the state. For example, when doing a `next` command, the
        tracer will wait for a `:line` event to occur within the same stack
        frame, or for the frame to be popped on a `:return` event, and only then
        will it invoke the controller.
      - While invoking the controller and waiting for its reply, the tracer
        optionally performs a fiber lock in order to prevent other fibers from
        advancing (the fiber lock is the default mode).
    - The tracer's state is completely inspectable

      ```ruby
      PolyTrace.state
      PolyTrace.current_fiber
      PolyTrace.call_stack
      ```

    - Modes can be changed using an API, e.g.

      ```ruby
      PolyTrace.fiber_lock = false
      ```

    - Fibers can be interrogated using an API, or perhaps using some kind of
      Pry command...

    - Normal mode of operation is fiber modal, that is, trace only the currently
      selected fiber. The currently selected fiber may be changed upon breakpoint

  - Step over should return on the next line *for the same fiber*
  - The event loop (all event loops?) should be suspended so timers are adjusted
    accordingly, so on control passing to debugger we:

    - call `ev_suspend()` for main thread ev_loop
    - prompt and wait for input from user
    - call `ev_resume()` for main thread ev_loop
    - process user input

    (We need to verify than `ev_suspend/resume` works for an ev_loop that's not
    currently running.)
  - Allow inspection of fiber tree, thread's run queue, fiber's scheduled values etc.

  - UI
    - `Kernel#breakpoint` is used to break into the debugger while running code

      ```ruby
      def test_sleep
        f = spin { sleep 10 }
        breakpoint
        ...
      end
      ```

      Hitting the breakpoint will show the current location in the source code
      (with few lines before and after), and present a prompt for commands.
    
    - commands:
      - `step` / `up` / `skip` / `continue` etc. - step into, step out, step over, run
      - `switch` - switch fiber
        - how do we select a fiber?
          - from a list?
          - from an expression: `Fiber.current.children`
          - maybe just `select f1` (where f1 is a local var)

- Allow locking the scheduler on to one fiber
  - Add instance var `@fiber_lock`
  - API is `Thread#fiber_lock` which sets the fiber_lock instance varwhile
    running the block:

    ```ruby
    def debug_prompt
      Thread.current.fiber_lock do
        ...
      end
    end
    ```
  - When `@fiber_lock` is set, it is considered as the only one in the run
    queue:

    ```c
    VALUE fiber_lock = rb_ivar_get(self, ID_ivar_fiber_lock);
    int locked = fiber_lock != Qnil;

    while (1) {
      next_fiber = locked ? fiber_lock : rb_ary_shift(queue);
      ...
    }
    ```

## 0.44

### Some more API work, more docs

- sintra app with database access (postgresql)

- sidekiq: Plan of action
  - see if we can get by just writing an adapter
  - if not, fork sidekiq, make adjustments to Polyphony code
  - test performance
  - proceed from there


## 0.45

### Sinatra / Sidekiq

- Pull out redis/postgres code, put into new `polyphony-xxx` gems

## 0.46

### Testing && Docs

- More tests
- Implement some basic stuff missing:
  - override `IO#eof?` since it too reads into buffer
  - real `IO#gets` (with buffering)
  - `IO#read` (read to EOF)
  - `IO.foreach`
  - `Process.waitpid`

## 0.47

### Real IO#gets and IO#read

## 0.48 DNS

### DNS client

```ruby
ip_address = DNS.lookup('google.com', 'A')
```

## Work on API

- Add option for setting the exception raised on cancelling using `#cancel_after`:

```ruby
cancel_after(3, with_error: MyErrorClass) do
  do_my_thing
end
# or a RuntimeError with message
cancel_after(3, with_error: 'Cancelled due to timeout') do
  do_my_thing
end
```
